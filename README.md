## CityPop
Arbetsprov WeKnowIt

## Description
This application is used to see how big the population for a city is. The user has two different choices.
1: Search for a city directly,
2: Search for a country, and you will be presented with the three biggest cities in that country. You can then click on the different cities see the population for the cities.

This application is built with React-Native and Expo. It uses the [GeoNames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/geonames-search.html)

The app is completed; however, it doesnâ€™t have a lot of functionality. If one were to continue working on the project there are many things that could be implemented, such as search suggestions.

## About the project:
